Cashflow control : 

First thought : Ever grabbed a coffee from a bakery , or a coffee shop ? So did I ! 
But how often ?


WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT :
 
The whole idea is to get some real data and observe individual behaviour when it comes to 
regular expenses.


The whole idea in general is to give an overview of:

- how much a person monthly / yearly spends.
- how many of these expenses can be avoided (if any)
- after identifying the mandatory costs, it's time to reduce these extras.
- from the costs we reduced we can now talk about savings for the future.

And with this in mind we can also may be able to convince a bank (when it comes to a loan for a house)
and maybe make things easier
